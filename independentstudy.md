# Independent Study Projects

We have a number of spots open for independent study projects at the BS and MS level. They are grouped by topic, and you should feel free to suggest projects of your own even if they are not listed on this page.

If you are uncertain about your own skills, consider looking up the resources we have prepared on both the [quantum information](/quantumonboarding) and [programming and software development](/sysadminonboarding). These cover skills you would need to succeed at an independent study project. Developing these skills can very much be a part of these independent studies, not something you have to master in advance.

We are also involved with the Google (and Julia) Summer of Code programs (on [Clifford circuit simulation](https://julialang.org/jsoc/gsoc/quantumclifford/) and [Quantum Optics](https://julialang.org/jsoc/gsoc/quantumoptics/)) and we run a number of [open-source bounty programs](https://github.com/QuantumSavory/.github/blob/main/BUG_BOUNTIES.md). Such projects can also be done as independent studies or as paid student jobs, depending on your interest and context. One of the goals of such projects is to introduce more folks to the open-source community, so do not hesitate to reach out if you are a novice.

If you are interested in any of these projects, contact Prof. Krastanov at [skrastanov@umass.edu](skrastanov@umass.edu).

You can also see a list of [past projects](/pastindependentstudy).
