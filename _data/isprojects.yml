  - title: Generating Expander Graphs and Error Correcting Codes
    recskill: Knowledge of linear algebra and some basic group theory and graph theory skills.
    description: "Error correcting codes are a group of techniques that permit encoding information in a protected redundant fashion, thus enabling reconstructing damaged records. Error correcting codes are usually represented as a set of linear equations that are fulfilled by the physical bits: thus limiting the"
