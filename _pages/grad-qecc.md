# COMPSCI 692U: Quantum Error Correcting Codes

The first few weeks of the course will consist of introduction to classical and quantum error correction through lectures by the instructors. After the introduction is completed, we will transition to the seminar part of the course where students will be studying and presenting recent advancements in quantum error correction. The main focus would be on topological codes like the surface and toric codes, and on good quantum codes like the recently developed quantum LDPC codes.

Students can register for either:

- one credit section where student will be expected to study the various provided papers on the topic and make at least one class presentation on such paper;
- three credit section which includes the above requirements and, in addition, students will be expected to propose and complete a course project in consultation with the instructors

This course will be executed together with similar concurrent gatherings at partner universities at the NSF Center for Quantum Networks.
