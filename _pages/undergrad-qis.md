Quantum information science (QIS) revolutionizes our understanding of the fundamental laws of the universe and promises world-altering improvements in a number of practical computational tasks. For theoretical computer scientists, QIS provides the means to unlock the ultimate computational powers available to us in this universe. For programmers and computer engineers, QIS offers the tools to run simulations and optimizations otherwise infeasible on classical computers. For theoretical physicists, QIS gives us hope of resolving paradoxes foundational to our understanding of Nature. And for experimentalists and engineers, QIS also enables the creation of exquisite sensors and novel communication tools, far outperforming what is classically permitted.

This class will introduce the notion of quantum probability amplitudes, i.e., the "correct" probabilistic description of Nature, and describe how these quantum phenomena permit the creation of new types of computational machines. The introduction to foundational quantum information science will be followed by a few practical (and impractical) quantum algorithms, illustrating the counterintuitive computational powers of quantum mechanics. The latter half of the class would focus on the difficulties of creating such extremely fragile computational machines in our noisy and unforgiving real world.

## Academic Honesty Statement

Copying of written homeworks, or exams or "teamwork" on an assignment (unless teaming is explicitly part of that assignment) is not permitted. You can talk to other students about the assignments, and ask/answer questions - it is great to learn from each other - but the work you hand in must be your own. A student found copying the work of others will receive a grade of F for the course (this is the college policy). If you are having trouble with an assignment or if you are having trouble meeting a deadline, see the instructor or the TA; we will bend over backwards to help you but we will not tolerate cheating. Please read the [UMass Academic Code of Conduct Policy](https://www.umass.edu/dean_students/codeofconduct).

## Accommodation Statement

The University of Massachusetts Amherst is committed to providing an equal educational opportunity for all students.  If you have a documented physical, psychological, or learning disability on file with Disability Services (DS), you may be eligible for reasonable academic accommodations to help you succeed in this course.  If you have a documented disability that requires an accommodation, please notify me within the first two weeks of the semester so that we may make appropriate arrangements.  For further information, please visit [Disability Services](https://www.umass.edu/disability/).
